                <h2>Blog Post 1: What is Web Development?</h2>
                <p>Web development encompasses the art and science of creating websites and web applications that operate on the internet. It involves a multidisciplinary approach, blending technical skills with creativity to build interactive and engaging digital experiences. At its core, web development revolves around three primary components: front-end development, back-end development, and full-stack development, which combines both front-end and back-end skills.

                    <br><br>Front-end development focuses on the client-side aspects of a website, dealing with the user interface and user experience. It involves languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and responsive designs that users interact with directly in their browsers.
                    
                    <br><br>Back-end development, on the other hand, handles the server-side logic and database management necessary for web applications to function. This includes server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, and frameworks such as Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails.
                    
                    <br><br>Full-stack development integrates both front-end and back-end development skills, enabling developers to work on all aspects of a web project, from designing the user interface to managing databases and server-side logic. As technology evolves, web development continues to expand its horizons, encompassing new tools, frameworks, and methodologies to meet the demands of modern digital experiences on the web.</p>
