I made this project in HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, Mysql.

so you need to configure xampp.


create a database with name appointment_system

then select this database and click on import then import the file that is give in my project directory name appointment_system.sql


then create a folder in the C drive where xammp is installed -- xampp -> htdocs -> create a folder

then copy and paste all the files like html php and css of my project in that folder

then start apache and mysql in xampp and open chrome browser and search localhost/foldername
